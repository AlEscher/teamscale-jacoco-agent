We use [semantic versioning][semver]

# 2.0.0

- [feature] added `convert` mode to do one-time conversion. The old behaviour is now reachable via the `watch` command.
  This means that all existing command line invocations of the tool must be changed to include the `watch` command.

# 1.4.0

- [feature] added `-d` switch to ignore non-identical, duplicate class files during report generation
