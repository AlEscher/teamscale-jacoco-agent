# Test Impact Analysis in Teamscale

## Concept

Regression testing is typically done in a retest-all strategy, even if most of the tests are
irrelevant when only considering a given small change. By collecting data of which test executes
which part of the system we can find out which tests are actually impacted by a given change.
More concrete this means we have to gather coverage information per test case.

Teamscale with its Test Impact Analysis augments this data with source code change
information and calculates the impacted tests for one or more changes. It's then the
responsibility of the test framework to execute only those.

## Setup

### Gradle

Most of the work can be automated by using the `teamscale` gradle plugin.

**Requirements:**
 - Gradle 4.6
 - Tests are executed via JUnit Platform

Add this to the top of your root `build.gradle` file.
```groovy
buildscript {
	repositories {
    mavenCentral()
		maven { url 'https://share.cqse.eu/public/maven/' }
	}
	dependencies {
		classpath 'eu.cqse:teamscale-gradle-plugin:1.2'
	}
}

apply plugin: 'teamscale'

teamscale {
    server {
        url = 'https://mycompany.com/teamsale'
        userName = 'build'
        userAccessToken = '7fa5.....'
        project = 'example-project-id'
    }
    testImpactMode = true

    // The following is optional. By default the plugin looks for a git
    // repository in the project's root directory and takes the branch and
    // timestamp of the currently checked out commit.
    commit {
        branchName = 'master'
        timestamp = 1521800427000L // Timestamp in milliseconds
    }
    

    // The commit message to show for the uploaded reports (optional, Default: 'Gradle Upload')
    message = 'Gradle Upload'

    // The reports that should be uploaded to Teamscale
    report {
        // The partition in Teamscale
        partition = 'Unit Tests'
        
        // Uploads testwise coverage
        testwiseCoverage()
        
        // Uploads jUnit reports
        jUnit()
        
        // Uploads google closure coverage (together with the java coverage) as testwise coverage
        googleClosureCoverage { js ->
            // The directory in which the google closure coverage files reside after the test
            js.destination = files("$rootDir/engine/com.teamscale.test/ui-test-coverage")
            // Ant patterns for which files to include/exclude in the final report
            js.excludes = ["**/google-closure-library/**", "**.soy.generated.js", "soyutils_usegoog.js"]
        }
    }
    
    // For performance reasons the classes to be instrumented and analyzed can be filtered to only include the relevant 
    // ones. Includes and excludes have to be specified as ant pattern with / as separators. (Optional)
    agent {
        excludes = [
            '**/generated/**'
        ]
        includes = [
            'com/package/my/**',
            'org/mine/**'
        ]
    }
    
    // Similar to the standard test task addition includes for the test discovery can be specified
    // The patterns have to be regular expressions (Optional)
    include 'com.mine.test.system.*'
    exclude '.*TeamscaleUITest'
    exclude '.*ETestProjectSetupTest'

}
```

Any of those settings can be overridden in the test task's closure. This is comes in handy if you have multiple test tasks.

```groovy
task unitTest(type: Test) {
    useJUnitPlatform {
        excludeTags 'integration'
    }
    teamscale.report.partition = 'Unit Tests'
}

task integrationTest(type: Test) {
    useJUnitPlatform {
        includeTags 'integration'
    }
    teamscale.report.partition = 'Integration Tests'
}
```
The Teamscale plugin generates a special task for every test task you define suffixed with `Impacted` e.g. `unitTestImpacted`.
This task automatically uploads the available tests to Teamscale and runs only the impacted tests for the last commit.
Afterwards `TESTWISE_COVERAGE` and `JUNIT` reports are uploaded to Teamscale. Setting the `--run-all-tests` allows to run all tests and still generate a TESTWISE_COVERAGE report for all tests.

Uploading reports can also be triggered independently of the `Impacted` task with `unitTestReportUpload`. Adding `-x unitTestReportUpload` lets you disable the automatic upload.

## Technical details

### 1. Upload Test Details

Since Teamscale does not have knowledge beforehand of which tests are available for execution, the list of available 
tests has to be uploaded to Teamscale.

```json
[
  {
    "internalId": "com/example/JUnit5Test/myFirstTest",
    "displayName": "My 1st JUnit 5 test! ðŸ˜Ž",
    "externalId": "[engine:junit-jupiter]/[class:com.example.JUnit5Test]/[method:myFirstTest(org.junit.jupiter.api.TestInfo)]"
  },
  {
    "internalId": "com/example/JUnit4Test/testAdd",
    "displayName": "testAdd",
    "externalId": "[engine:junit-vintage]/[runner:com.example.JUnit4Test]/[test:testAdd(com.example.project.JUnit4Test)]"
  },
  {
    "internalId": "com/example/JUnit4Test/systemTest",
    "displayName": "systemTest",
    "externalId": "[engine:junit-vintage]/[runner:com.example.JUnit4Test]/[test:systemTest(com.example.project.JUnit4Test)]"
  }
]
```

- `internalId` Is a file system like path, which is used to uniquely identify a test within Teamscale and should be 
  chosen accordingly. It is furthermore used to make the set of tests hierarchically navigable within Teamscale.
- `externalId` Is an identifier of the test which is used within the test execution tool.
- `displayName` *(optional)* Is a human readable name of the test itself used for UI only.
- `sourcePath` *(optional)* Path to the source of the method if the test is specified in a programming language and is 
  known to Teamscale. Will be equal to `internalId` in most cases, but e.g. in JUnit `@Test` annotated methods in a base 
  class will have the sourcePath pointing to the base class, which contains the actual implementation, whereas 
  `internalId` will contain the class name of the most specific subclass from where it was actually executed.
- `content` *(optional)* Identifies the content of the test specification. This can be used to indicate that the 
  specification of a test has changed and therefore should be re-executed. The value can be an arbitrary string value 
  e.g. a hash of the test specification or a revision number of the test.

The upload is possible via the `Report Upload` REST-API with the `TEST_LIST` format.

### 2. Query impacted tests

You can get the impacted tests from Teamscale via the `Test Impact` REST-API, which returns a list of external test IDs 
that can be used to select the according tests for execution.
Since the analysis of the uploaded test details can take a few seconds (depending on the current server load) and 
Teamscale needs this data to be available in order to perform the Test Impact Analysis this service may return `null` 
to indicate, that the test details are not yet available. The client should periodically retry this call until it 
succeeds. If no tests are selected the result is an empty list instead.

### 3. Upload TESTWISE_COVERAGE report (and other artifacts)

During the test execution the coverage produced by each test case has to be saved separately.
After the execution the collected testwise coverage needs to be converted to the following format.
If possible the covered lines can already be compressed to method level, but this step is optional and only needed in 
order to reduce the file size of the final report.

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<report>
    <test externalId="[engine:junit-jupiter]/[class:com.example.project.JUnit5Test]/[method:systemTest()]">
        <path name="com/example/project">
            <file name="Calculator.java">
                <lines nr="13-15,20,24-30"/>
                ...
            </file>
            ...
        </path>
        ...
    </test>
    <test externalId="[engine:junit-jupiter]/[class:com.example.project.JUnit5Test]/[method:testAdd()]">
        ...
    </test>
    ...
</report>
```

The report may then be uploaded to Teamscale via the `Report Upload` REST-API by specifying `TESTWISE_COVERAGE` as 
report format.

## Rest API

To authorize the request Teamscale requires you to use Basic Authentication.
This means that the request should contain an `Authentication` header with the content `Basic ` followed by a Base64 
encoded version of `userName:userAccessToken`.

___
### Test Impact

  Returns the tests, which should be executed for the given set of changes. The set of changes is described by two 
  commits: The baseline commit and the end commit. All code changes after the baseline (exclusive) and before 
  end (inclusive) are considered. Also tests which have been changed in between are considered for execution.

  The `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers should be set to `application/json` for this request.

* **URL**

  p/{projectName}/test-impact/{uniformPathPrefix}

* **Method:**

  `GET`

*  **URL Parameters**

   `projectName` Project identifier within Teamscale

   `uniformPathPrefix` *(optional)* Tells the service to only return tests whose uniformPath starts with the given prefix.

*  **Query Parameters**

   `baseline=[branch]:[timestamp]` The baseline commit (when appending `p1` as postfix, the commit before the given one is chosen)

   `end=[branch]:[timestamp]` Identifies the commit which is associated with the upload (e.g. the commit for which coverage has been collected)

   `partition=[string]` The partition to get impacted tests for.

* **Success Response:**

  * **Code:** 200 <br />
    **Content:**
    Returns a list of external IDs.
    ```json
    [
      "[engine:junit-jupiter]/[class:com.example.JUnit5Test]/[method:myFirstTest(org.junit.jupiter.api.TestInfo)]",
      "[engine:junit-vintage]/[runner:com.example.JUnit4Test]/[test:testAdd(com.example.project.JUnit4Test)]"
    ]
    ```

    Since the analysis of the uploaded test details can take a few seconds (depending on the current server load) and 
    Teamscale needs this data to be available in order to perform the test impact analysis this service may return `null` 
    to indicate, that the test details are not yet available. The client should periodically retry this call until it 
    succeeds. 


* **Error Response:**

  * **Code:** 401 UNAUTHORIZED <br />
    **Content:** `failure`
